# Multi-Objective Optimization of Offshore Wind Farm Site Selection: A Case Study of Kaliningrad Region's EEZ

## Overview

This repository contains materials related to my bachelor's thesis, which focuses on selecting optimal locations for offshore wind farms using advanced multi-objective optimization methods. Specifically, the study addresses the optimization problem within the Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) of the Kaliningrad region, leveraging evolutionary algorithms and spatial data analysis.

## Objectives

The main goal of this research is to:
- Maximize average annual wind speed;
- Minimize water depth;
- Minimize distance to the nearest port.

## Methodology

The study employs:
- **NSGA-III** (Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm III) for multi-objective optimization;
- Spatial datasets from the Global Wind Atlas and GEBCO bathymetric data;
- Regression-based interpolation methods for wind speed and water depth estimation;
- Graph-based shortest-path algorithms for calculating optimal distances to the port.

## Results

The optimization yielded a Pareto front of **non-dominated solutions**, clearly demonstrating trade-offs among the objectives.


## Future Work

This study serves as a foundation for more detailed analyses, potentially incorporating additional environmental, economic, and regulatory factors to further refine site selection methodologies.
